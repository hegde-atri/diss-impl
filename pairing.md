1. First find out your waffle robot number. Lets say that the robot number is 19 for now.
2. run `waffle 19 pair`. this question asks a confirmation question to which you need to type y and hit enter.
3. run `waffle 19 bringup`. this command makes sure that ros is now running on the robot.
4. run `waffle 19 bridge` to run the zenoh bridge to connect to the waffle robot.

You can know if you are paired and live with the robot if the zenoh bridge process is running.
